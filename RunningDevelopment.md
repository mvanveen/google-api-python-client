# setpath.sh #

Instead of installing the client library you can run the following
from the root of the project directory and it will add the library
to the PYTHONPATH, obviating the need to install the library:

```
$ source setpath.sh
```

Note that you must have all the Python libraries that google-api-python-client relies upon installed.
