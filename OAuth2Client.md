# Introduction #

The `oauth2client` library makes it easy to connect to resources protected by [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/). The `oauth2client` library comes as part of the google-api-python-client, but is also available as a separate download if you just need the OAuth 2.0 capabilities.

The library supports these Python environments:

  * Python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7
  * Google App Engine
  * Django

[Download a release package](http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/downloads/list).

# Features #

This is a pure Python library that can be used from any platform. Samples are included for Google App Engine, and Django. The library has been tested against the Google and DailyMotion implementations of OAuth 2.0.

The code is currently in Beta and under active development. Please report all bugs in the [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/issues/list) and [ask questions in the discussion forum](http://groups.google.com/group/google-api-python-client).
